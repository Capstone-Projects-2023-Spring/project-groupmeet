## Use-case descriptions

## Use case 1: Assigned Group Project
1. Students gather together after being assigned a group project.
2. One student logs into the GroupMeet app and creates a new group.
3. A code/QR code/link is generated, and the one student shares their screen with the rest of the group.
4. Every other student in the group has free choice of writing down the code and inputting later, scanning the QR code immediately, clicking on the link and instantly redirecting to joining on the app, etc.
5. Once all group members have joined the GroupMeet group, a calendar is generated with everyone’s schedules in mind.
6. A group member sees that Friday the 27th from 7PM – 9PM is a time where everyone is available, so they click on that day and propose it.
7. Upon proposing it, a notification is sent to all other group members, asking them to approve of this date and time.
8. All group members approve of this date and time.
9. Another group member later realizes that they actually cannot make that time, so they override that decision.
10. Upon overriding this decision, a notification is sent to all group members with a suggestion that GroupMeet makes as to what other time(s) would work.
11. Example: “Something came up for Adam and he can no longer make it on FRIDAY 27TH from 7PM – 9PM. How does SATURDAY 28TH from 2PM – 4PM sound?” in which Saturday 28th from 2PM – 4PM is the next time where everyone is available.

## Use case 2: Busy Friends
1. A friend group has been trying to get together for dinner for a long time, but nobody is dedicated enough to coordinate everyone’s schedules.
2. One friend texts a link to the friend group chat to install GroupMeet.
3. Each friend installs GroupMeet, creates an account and syncs their Google calendars.
4. GroupMeet then puts them into the group originally stored in the link generated by the first friend.
5. Before GroupMeet can generate a static calendar, there is one friend who needs to be accounted for. This friend registered without syncing a Google calendar, and also has no plans to fill one in.
6. This friend gets to see a pre-released static calendar in which they see when everyone else is available. They then simply look at all of the available times and quickly fill in all of their available times manually.
7. Once this friend is finished filling times manually, the static calendar is generated and released to the entire group.
