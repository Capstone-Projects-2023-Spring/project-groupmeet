**Purpose**

The Design Document - Part I Architecture describes the software architecture and how the requirements are mapped into the design. This document will be a combination of diagrams and text that describes what the diagrams are showing.

**Requirements**

In addition to the general requirements the Design Document - Part I Architecture will contain:

A description the different components and their interfaces. For example: client, server, database.

**Class Diagrams**
**Diagram 1**
```mermaid
classDiagram
    MyApp-->MyHomePage
    MyHomePage --|> StatefulWidget
    note for StatefulWidget "Library in Flutter"
    _MyHomePageState --|> State
    note for State "Library in Flutter"
    _MyHomePageState<--MyHomePage

    class MyApp{
      -key
      +build(context)
    }

    class MyHomePage{
      +title
      +createState()
    }

    class _MyHomePageState{
        +DatabaseReference
        +_emailCont
        +_passwordCont
        +userCredential
        +uid
        +login()
        +logout()
        +build(context)
    }

    AccountInfo --|> StatefulWidget
    _AccountInfoState --|> State
    AccountInfo-->_AccountInfoState
    
    class AccountInfo{
        +title
        +createState()
    }

    class _AccountInfoState{
        +build(context)
    }

    CreateAccount --|> StatefulWidget
    _CreateAccountState --|> State
    CreateAccount-->_CreateAccountState

    class CreateAccount{
        +title
        +createState()
    }

    class _CreateAccountState{
        +_emailController
        +_passwordController
        +_fnameController
        +_lnameController
        +ref
        +uid
        +createUserProfile()
        +build()
    }
```

**Sequence Diagrams**
**Use Case 1: Registration**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    User->>GroupMeet: Open application
    User->>+GroupMeet: Registers using form field
    GroupMeet->>+FirebaseAuthentication: createUserWithEmailAndPassword()
    FirebaseAuthentication->>+RealtimeDatabase: Creates a new entry
    RealtimeDatabase-->>-FirebaseAuthentication: Creation Successful
    FirebaseAuthentication-->>-GroupMeet: Account Created
    GroupMeet-->>-User: Prompts to confirm email address
    User->>+GroupMeet: Validates email address
    GroupMeet-->>-User: Confirms validation, thanks user
```
**Use Case 2: Login**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    User->>GroupMeet: Open application
    User->>+GroupMeet: Login
    GroupMeet->>+FirebaseAuthentication: signInWithEmailAndPassword()
    FirebaseAuthentication->>+RealtimeDatabase: Queries Database
    RealtimeDatabase-->>-FirebaseAuthentication: Query Successful
    FirebaseAuthentication-->>-GroupMeet: Account found
    GroupMeet->>+RealtimeDatabase: Queries for any linked social media
    RealtimeDatabase-->>-GroupMeet: No results found
    GroupMeet-->>-User: Prompts user to link social media
    User->>+GroupMeet: Validates social media accounts
    GroupMeet->>+RealtimeDatabase: adds accounts to entry
    RealtimeDatabase-->>-GroupMeet: entry updated
    GroupMeet-->>-User: Thanks user for information
```
**Use Case 3: Event Creation**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant GroupMeet App
    participant Firebase Authentication
    participant Realtime Database

    User->>+ GroupMeet App: login()
    GroupMeet App->>+Firebase Authentication: signInWithEmailAndPassword()
    User->>+GroupMeet App: Presses button to create a new group
    GroupMeet App -->> User: Prompts user for group information
    User->>+GroupMeet App: Enters group information
    GroupMeet App->>+Realtime Database : Update information to group settings
```
**Use Case 4: Invite Other Users**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User1
    actor User2
    participant GroupMeet App
    participant Realtime Database
    
    User1->>+GroupMeet App: Presses button to create a new group
    GroupMeet App -->> User1: Prompts user for group information
    User1->>+GroupMeet App: Enters group information
    GroupMeet App->>+Realtime Database : Update information to group settings
    GroupMeet App ->>+ GroupMeet App: QR code/link/code is generated
    User2->>+ User2: Scan the QR code and click the link
    User2->>+ GroupMeet App: Join scheduling group
```
**Use Case 5: Time Block Selection**
<!-- ```mermaid
    TODO
``` -->
**Use Case 6: Last Second Changes**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Group
    actor UserX
    actor UserY
    participant GroupMeet App

    Group->>GroupMeet App: All users join the group
    GroupMeet App->>+ GroupMeet App: Static Calendar is generated with everyone's schedules
    UserX->>GroupMeet App: Selects "green" time (where everyone is available), clicking on the time and proposing it
    GroupMeet App->>Group: Sends notifications to all members, asking for time approval
    Group->>GroupMeet App: All users approve meeting time
    UserY->>GroupMeet App: User later realizes that they actually cannot make that time
    UserY->>GroupMeet App: Cancels the current meeting time
    GroupMeet App->>Group: Sends notifications to all members
    GroupMeet App->>Group: Notification includes notice of cancellation and suggestion for next best time to meet

```
**Use Case 7: Modification of Project Lifespan**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    actor UserX
    participant System

    User->>System: Logs in
    User->>System: Navigates to Group Settings
    User->>System: Selects Longevity
    System->>User: Prompts user with add new, change existing, or delete current timeline options
    User->>System: Chooses Change Existing
    System->>User: Prompts user with calendar
    User->>System: User selects new timeline date
    User->>System: User saves new timeline
    System->>UserX: Sends message to Group Chat with new timeline adjustments
    UserX->>System: Receives message from System
    System->>User: Confirms change of timeline
```
**Use Case 8: Push Notifications and Reminders**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant GroupMeet App
    participant Message Server

    GroupMeet App->>User: Receives a meeting reminder message
    User->>GroupMeet App: Taps on the message
    GroupMeet App->>Message Server: Fetches details about the meeting
    Message Server->>GroupMeet App: Return details about the meeting
    GroupMeet App->>User: Shows a pop-up message with meeting details
    User->>GroupMeet App: Taps on the active status
    GroupMeet App->>User: Shows a description of the status
    User->>GroupMeet App: Clicks on the "X" button
    GroupMeet App->>User: Closes the pop-up menu
    User->>GroupMeet App: Returns to the app's home page
    GroupMeet App->>User: Brings user back to homepage
```
Describe algorithms employed in your project, e.g. neural network paradigm, training and training data set, etc.

If there is a database:

**Entity-relation diagram
```mermaid
erDiagram
    Users{
        string uid 
        string name
        string email    
        Object socialMedia[]
        string teamIds[]
    }
    Teams{
        string teamId 
        string teamName
        string teamAdmin
        string uids[]
    }
