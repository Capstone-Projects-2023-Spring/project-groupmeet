# Acceptance test

**1. Registration and Login**
-Expected Result: The user is able to register an account, and login using said account. They will then be routed to a home page, where they can then view their account information and enter in their social media preferences. The user can also integrate calendars, which can all be viewed within Round. Any existing groups they are a part of will also be listed.

**2. Group Creation and Invitations**
-Expected Result: The user can create a group, enter information about it, and then have link which can then be shared among other group members. These group members can then use this link to add the group to their owns accounts (which they may need to register for).

**3. Calendar Integration and Finding an open time slot**
-Expected Result: With all group-mates entered into the application, and their calendars successfully integrated into the application, Round will then find a good available slot for everyone to meet up on. This slot is then sent to all group members as a push notification, and they prepare for that particular date.

**4. Social Media Integration**
-Expected Result: When all group-mates enter in social media platforms they prefer, Round will find common ground between all the users, and then notify them of the platform that was found. If possible, the application will also create a group for the users to use, but if not a list of all user handles will be presented for ease of group creation on those platforms.
